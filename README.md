## Configuration

### Styles

You can import into JS(TS) files CSS files. It is valid, but note that they aren't provide value for import. If you do so, there will be error.

```ts
// Valid
import './some_file.css';

// Invalid
import styles from './some_file.css';
```

For possibility to import value from styles, define style as _module_. Then you will can to get selectors from imported value (they will be generated by `PostCSS`).

> _Module_ is a file that satisfies such pattern: `"\\.(m|mod|module)\\.(c|le|sa|sc|pc|postc)ss$"`.

```ts
import styles from './some_file.module.css';

// Here will be generated "main" class.
const mainClass = styles.main;
```

#### PostCSS

If you use [PostCSS](https://postcss.org) as CSS preprocessor and you use VSCode for development, you may want to install [PostCSS language support](https://github.com/csstools/postcss-language) plugin for VSCode, that adds support for modern and experimental CSS. Autocompletion is already configured for files with `.pcss` and `.postcss` extensions (though there is [bug with autocompletion with this plugin](https://github.com/csstools/postcss-language/issues/2)).
